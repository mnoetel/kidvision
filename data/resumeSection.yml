  ## What KidVision involves

  It’s hard for parents to know what their children do with their time. We don’t remember what our kids did all day yesterday, and our kids don’t remember either. We also don't see most of the things our children see, from advertising to different media.


  The groundbreaking part of this study is the use of secure, **paramedic-grade wearable cameras** to measure what children are doing, and a research-grade FitBit-like device to measure sleep and physical activity.
  With stringent privacy controls, the study involves the following steps.
